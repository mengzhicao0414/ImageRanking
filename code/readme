Step 1: run startup.m: set up search paths
Step 2: run UMISTcompare.m or FGNETcompare.m 

For UMISTdataset, we should run UMISTcompare.m to compare the performance of the methods LDMLR and cMDS-DML.
For FG-NETdataset, we should run FGNETcompare.m to compare the performance of the methods LDMLR and cMDS-DML.

cMDS_DML: save the code of the method cMDS_DML, and cMDS_DML.m in it is the main code for training and testing.
LDMLR: save the code of the method LDMLR, and LDMLR.m in it is the main code for training and testing.

UMISTdateset: save the data and its label of UMIST image dataset. UMIST in it is downloaded on website. UMISTdata.csv and UMISTlabel.csv are reprocessed by us.
FGNETdateset: save the data and its label of FG-NET image dataset. FGNET in it is downloaded on website. FGNETdata.csv and FGNETlabel.csv are reprocessed by us.
